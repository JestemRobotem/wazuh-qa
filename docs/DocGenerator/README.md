# Wazuh QA DocGenerator
Wazuh - Quality assurance automation self-contained documentation parsing tool.

## Rational
Wazuh QA documentation is designed to be self-contained into the source code of each test.

DocGenerator is the tool in charge of parsing the documentation block from each source code and generate data capable
to be indexed and displayed.

## Design
### Input
DocGenerator parses the information from test files containing a specific comment format:

Each test file has self-contained documentation comment blocks in **YAML** format.

These blocks can contain **Mandatory**, **Optional**, and **Ignored** fields.
In the [Configuration section](#configuration) it's explained how to configure these fields.
- **Mandatory** fields must be present in the documentation block and will be added to the final
documentation output files.
- **Optional** fields, if present, will be parsed and added to the final documentation output files.
- **Ignored** fields are the ones not listed in the configuration file. They can be added by the developer to explain
a specific functionality without including this information in the final documentation output files.

Each test file has a header docstring that details information related to the whole test file.
And each test method inside the file will have a test documentation block with the specific information of
this test.

Additional group information is parsed from the README files found in the repository. Each README file represents
a group, and every test file at the same or lower folder level is considered as belonging to it.

Also, groups could be nested, so a README file found under the level of a group will generate a new group that belongs
to the first one.

The specific content of each block is defined in the [Documentation schema section](#documentation-schema)

### Parsing
Running DocGenerator as specified in the [Usage section](#usage) will scan every test and group file found into the
include paths of the documentation, it will extract the module and tests blocks from each test file and discard any
non-documentable field. Also, complementary test-cases information will be extracted from a dry-run of pytest if there
isn´t a description for them.

### Output
The parsed and filtered documentation information will be added to the Output folder defined by configuration.

Each test file will generate a JSON and a YAML file with the documentation information. Each of these files contains
a structure with the module description and every test function in the module. Each test function
contains its description and, if available, the test-cases information.

These files are ordered in nested folders with the same tree structure as the source code files.

### Sanity Check
After the generation of the documentation output, a sanity check can be executed to identify coverage, tags and
any missing mandatory field.

### Indexing
The JSON files generated by DocGenerator are intended to be indexed into elasticsearch and later be displayed by the Search-UI App.
So, DocGenerator treats each JSON file as a document that will be added to elasticsearch index.

### Local launch
Together with the Indexing functionality, the tool has the capability to locally lunch SearchUI to visualize the
documentation content into the App UI.

### Documentation schema
| Version |
| ---     |
| 0.1     |

**Module block** This block will be at the top of the python module:
|**Name**|**Type**|**Requirement**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|---|
|brief|String|Mandatory|Module description|
|metada|Block|Mandatory|Canister for below items|
|component|List|Mandatory|The Wazuh component (Manager/Agent) aimed with the test|
|modules|List|Mandatory|Modules tested|
|daemons|List|Mandatory|Daemons running during the test|
|operating_systems|List|Mandatory|OS where the tests should be run|
|tiers|List|Optional|Useful tags for searching purposes|
|tags|List|Optional|Useful tags for searching purposes|

Here is an example of how this Documentation block should look like and the hierarchy of these fields.

    '''
    brief: Module description
    metadata:
        modules:
            - Wazuh DB
        daemons:
            - wazuh_db
        component:
            - Manager
        operating_systems:
            - Windows
            - Ubuntu
        tiers:
            - 0
            - 1
        tags:
            - Enrollment
    '''

**Tests block** This block will be at the description comment of each function test:
|**Name**|**Type**|**Requirement**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|---|
|test_logic|String|Mandatory|The main description of what the test does|
|checks|List|Mandatory|A list of what the test checks|

Here is an example of how this Documentation block should look like and the hierarchy of these fields.

    """
      test_logic:
          "Check that Wazuh DB creates the agent database when a query with a new agent ID is sent.

          Also..."
      checks:
          - The received output must match with...
          - The received output with regex must match with...
    """

## Configuration
The configuration file of the tool is located at **./config.yaml**.

### Configurable values
- **Project path**: The path of the complete project from where the documentation will be extracted. This path will be
used during a sanity check to count every existent test in the project and calculate the coverage of the documentation.

- **Output path**: The path where all the parsed documentation blocks will be dumped.

- **Include paths**: A list with all the paths from where the tool will look to extract and parse the documentation
blocks.

- **Include regex**: A list of regexes to identify which files must be considered a test file.

- **Group files**: A list of regexes to identify which files must be considered a group file.

- **Function regex**: A list of regexes to identify which methods inside a test file must be considered a test method.

- **Ignore paths**: A list with the paths that should be bypassed during the parsing scan.

- **Output fields**: Lists with the expected fields in the documentation. There is a list for the modules fields and
another for test fields. In turn, each of them is divided into Mandatory and Optional fields.
During a sanity check, it will be checked that every Mandatory field is present in the respective documentation block.
During the parsing, every field not present in the Mandatory or the Optional fields will be ignored.

- **Test cases field**: Key to identify the test cases of each test. If this field is missing in the documentation block
of a test, the tool will execute a dry run of pytest to automatically find all the test cases of the test and append
this information with the key specified. If this option is missing, or if the key is found in the test documentation
block, this action is avoided.

## Usage

### Parsing
    python3 DocGenerator.py

Without using any flag, the tool will load the configuration file and run a complete parse of the paths in the
configuration to dump the content into the output folder.

### Sanity Check
    python3 DocGenerator.py -s

Using **-s**, the tool will run a sanity check of the content in the output folder.

It will check the coverage of the already parsed files in the **Output path** comparing it with the tests found in
**Project path**.
Also, it will validate that the output files have every Mandatory field.
It will also list and report every tag found.

### Debug
    python3 DocGenerator.py -d

Using **-d**, the tool runs in DEBUG mode, logging extra information in the log file.

### Version
    python3 DocGenerator.py -v

Using **-v**, the tool will print its current version.

### Config Test
    python3 DocGenerator.py -t
Using **-t** option, the tool will load the config file to test the correct content.

### Index output data
    python3 DocGenerator.py -i <INDEX_NAME>
Using **-i** option, the tool indexes the content of each file output as a document into ElasticSearch. The name of the index
must be provided as a parameter.

### Local launch output data
    python3 DocGenerator.py -l <INDEX_NAME>
Using **-l** option, the tool indexes the content of each file output as a document into ElasticSearch and launches the application. The name of the index must be provided as a parameter.
